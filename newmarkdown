This is a new file, added to my repo.

Github is not something I use in my analytics work right now as everything we do is pretty individually based, and code review isn't a part of our workflow. 
Code review is more in the manner of applying domain knowledge to outputs and critiquing. In our Data Science team which is built around
modelling, I know they use GitHub quite a bit. 

Right now I am trying to understand the mechanics of how to make things happen and just what all of the terminology means. Right now it feels like managing
the repo is a job unto itself, but hopefully over time that feeling will change where it's just a part of the flow/workstream.
